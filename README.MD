JSON Bourne is a .NET Core 3.0-compatible JSON serializer and deserializer designed to work with UTF-8 JSON data 
directly. The library aims to provide easy-to-use high-performance API.

## Requirements
The library is built for .NET Core 3.0. It is therefore required that you have .NET Core SDK 3.0 or better installed. 
I recommend Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.5 or newer) for your IDE. If you are on Linux, Visual Studio Code is my 
recommendation.

You are required to know C# on at least intermediate level before attempting to use the library. I will not take any 
time to explain language basics to you, and if you come to me without understanding the language, I will simply 
redirect you to [the C# guide][9].

### Building
Building JsonBourne from source is possible on both Windows and GNU/Linux operating systems. For more detailed 
instructions, check out the [building guide][10].

## Installation and usage
First you need to install the library. You can obtain the latest stable releases from [NuGet][5], or, if you're 
feeling adventurous, you can try the latest nightly builds from [SlimGet][6].

## Documentation and examples
Complete documentation for the project can be found [right here][1], with a quick start guide available [here][2].

Complete examples can be found in the [examples directory][3].
